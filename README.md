NOTE: Full documentation is coming soon (by end of February 2018)

There a couple main use cases here:

- Building a new OpenShift cluster on on-premise infrastructure (RHV, VMware & OpenStack)
- Adding new application nodes to existing infrastructure

I may explore doing stuff with EC2, Azure and other cloud providers, but I feel like that is mostly well-handled out of the box with OpenShift.
